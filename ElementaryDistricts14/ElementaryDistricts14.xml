The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.
School Districts are single-purpose administrative units within which local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents.  The Census Bureau obtains the boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels for school districts from State officials for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with estimates of the number of children in poverty within each school district.  This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to States and school districts.  
TIGER/Line Shapefiles include separate shapefiles for elementary, secondary and unified school districts. The school district boundaries are those in effect for the 2013-2014 school year.</abstract><purpose>In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>201306</begdate><enddate>201405</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>Publication Date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>No changes or updates will be made to this version of the TIGER/Line Shapefiles.

Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area.  All polygons are tested for closure.
The Census Bureau uses its internally developed geographic update system to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census MAF/TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian areas, and congressional districts are used when encoding spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census MAF/TIGER database files.  Most of the codes for geographic entities except states, counties, urban areas, Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), American Indian Areas (AIAs), and congressional districts were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).  Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.
For the TIGER/Line Shapefiles, the Point and Vector Object Count for the G-polygon SDTS Point and Vector Object Type reflects the number of records in the shapefile attribute table.  For multi-polygon features, only one attribute record exists for each multi-polygon rather than one attribute record per individual G-polygon component of the multi-polygon feature.  TIGER/Line Shapefile multi-polygons are an exception to the G-polygon object type classification.  Therefore, when multi-polygons exist in a shapefile, the object count will be less than the actual number of G-polygons.</logic><complete>Data completeness of the TIGER/Line Shapefiles reflects the contents of the Census MAF/TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line Shapefiles were created.</complete><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division</origin><pubdate>Unpublished material</pubdate><title>Census MAF/TIGER database</title></citeinfo></srccite><typesrc>online</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>201306</begdate><enddate>201405</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><srccurr>Publication Date</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>MAF/TIGER</srccitea><srccontr>All line segments</srccontr></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>TIGER/Line Shapefiles are extracted from the Census MAF/TIGER database by nation, state, county, and entity.

Used the Select by Location tool to select all features falling within the Rhode Island state boundary. Exported these features to their own shapefile before re-projecting the data from GCS North American, to Rhode Island State Plane Feet. Further modification of the dataset was necessary as there were three features included that were Unified districts (a district that has both elementary and secondary schooling available) and not elementary districts. To do this, an editing session was opened on the Rhode Island "Unified Districts" shapefile. The three features were then selected in the elementary district shapefile, copied, and pasted into the Unified Districts shapefile. These were then deleted from the elementary districts shapefile. The districts requiring relocation from the elementary districts shapefile to the unified districts shapefile were: Exeter West Greenwich Regional School District, the Jamestown School District and the Little Compton School District.
